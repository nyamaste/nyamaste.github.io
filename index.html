							<h1>Hi! I'm <b>Dmitriy Vi</b>.</h1>
							<p class="major">...also known as <a target="_blank" href="https://instagram.com/nyamaste">@nyamaste</a>. I live and work in <i>Los Angeles, California</i> and occasionally throughout the world. My passions include <a href="#first" class="smooth-scroll">movement</a> (yoga, acroyoga, and handstands), <a href="#second" class="smooth-scroll">photography</a>, and <a href="#third" class="smooth-scroll">DevOps</a>.

							<h2>Movement</h2>
							<p>I was never athletic as a child or teenager, but in 2011 I fell in love with movement through the practice of yoga. I've since completed two yoga teacher trainings (RYT-200) and have spent at least a year training movement disciplines beyond yoga - circus arts, aerial fitness, handbalancing, and dance, to name a few. Today I teach handstands and partner acrobatics at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vedayogacenter.com/schedule/">Veda Yoga Center</a> and continue training in various forms of movement.</p>
							<p>Interested in private coaching in any of these disciplines? Private coaching rates start at just $60/hour and I'm available throughout Los Angeles and (occasionally) the rest of the world. You can <a target="_blank" href="https://mailchi.mp/0eb393a3edd7/subscribe-general">subscribe to my newsletter</a> to be the first to learn of my whereabouts and latest promotions.</p>

							<h2>Photography</h2>
							<p>I have been creating artful images of my friends in various movement disciplines since 2015, improving my style and sense of taste year over year. You can see my photographic journey through my <a target="_blank" href="https://instagram.com/nyamaste">@nyamaste</a> profile.</p>
							<p>Like my style and want to see yourself in images like these? I specialize in active photography - yoga, dance, acrobatics - and photosession rates start at just $100/hour.

							<h2>DevOps: Development and Operations</h2>
							<p>I've graduated with Computer Science degree from UCLA and have been working in DevOps field since 2011. Aside from helping my employer design, develop, and maintain AWS-based infrastructure and services, I've participated in on-call duties and have extensively worked remotely and outside of normal office hours. My specialties in this field include infrastructure automation, monitoring and log delivery, continuous delivery, cost optimization, and security.</p>
							<p>In 2014-15 I've developed a Python-based <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vindimy/altcointip">Reddit altcointip bot</a>, at the height of golden rush in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This is the only freely-available and completely functional open-source project of its kind.</p>
